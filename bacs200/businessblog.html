        <p class="text-left">
            What Happens when you Trade Long Term?
        </p>
        <ul> for example:
            <li>A person who decides to get into trading on a long term scale can expect slow, but steady income. The best move is to buy fee free ETF's. A certain ammount each paycheck. THis will beat the market long term by about 3 percent. Better than any bank account.</li>
            <li>It is not without its risks though. Say you bought $SPY, an ETF that is made up of the 500 biggest traded companies on the NYSE. And one of those pesky pandemic hits, and your stock tanks. That cannot happen in a savings account.</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h3 class="display-4 Font-weight-light text-left bg-link p-3">Societal Outcomes</h3><p class="text left">

            What can society expect?
        <ul>
            <li>When someone trades long term they are stimulating the economy. If they purchase $SPY, they are subsequentally funding the 500 biggest companies in the US. A neccessity for companies to function and innovate.
            </li>
            <li>If the companies were to fail and a person were to lose their money, this could hurt their personal life. Therefore, putting stress on various safetynets in society. A broke person with no hope will not be good for society.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-left">

            How are politics in play here?.
        <ul>
            <li>As many of us know, polotics and the stock market are intertwined. Companies you invest in may use that money to lobby politicians in their interests. Also, a good stock market mean happy people and contenment with leadership. A bad economy leads to change in the people in power. </li>
