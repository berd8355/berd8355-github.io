    <p>
        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Willing to say what needs to be said - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
        <li>Has an Imapct - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        <li>Innovative - Think outside the box</li>
        <li>Honesty - regardless of consequences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since the dawn of the social media age, no man has done more for public discourse. In a world filled with lies and deceit, Joe is a diamond in the rough.
